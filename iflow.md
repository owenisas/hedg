What’s missing are the engines that make it a real “hedge-anything” tool (plus a few UI pieces that express them). Here’s a tight gap map you can build against.

Your task is to complete all of them
# Product gaps (the big rocks)

* **Exposure form & schema (must-have)**
  A modal/panel to capture: risk statement, horizon, budget, venue/jurisdiction constraints, payout preference. Persist as `ExposureSpec`.
* **Basket builder & pre-trade check**
  Side panel that shows candidate markets with: resolution text, **fit score**, **expected depth**, **slippage guard**, **proposed weight**, **estimated coverage %**.
* **Execution review dialog**
  One “Confirm & Execute” sheet with order list, limits, fees, and a receipt hash preview.
* **Live Positions dashboard**
  Positions table, order blotter, fills, P&L, **coverage vs residual risk**, rebalance buttons, alerts.
* **Receipts & audit**
  Downloadable JSON/PDF containing spec → decisions → orders → fills (tamper-evident hash).

# Network graph: what the nodes should be (and aren’t yet)

Right now your nodes are generic finance metrics (Sharpe, VaR, etc.). For this product they should be **markets/events**.

| Element    | Current                     | Should be                                       | Why                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Node       | “Sharpe Ratio”, “VaR”, etc. | **A single market/event** (title, venue, dates) | Let users pick **actual hedge legs**    |
| Node size  | n/a                         | **Relevance/weight**                            | Visual weight = proposed budget %       |
| Node badge | n/a                         | **Fit score / liquidity chip**                  | Fast read: “0.72 fit · $$ depth”        |
| Edge       | abstract “correlation”      | **Rule/semantic link** or price co-move link    | Justify why two markets belong together |

Add a right-rail **Inspector**: rule text, pros/cons, why it helps, what it misses, toggle + weight slider.

# Frontend gaps (components you’ll want)

* **ExposureForm** (new): schema-driven, validates budget/time/venues (Zod/Yup).
* **CandidateList** (new): sortable table with Fit/Liquidity/Cost/Window columns.
* **ExecutionSheet** (new): orders preview, fee/impact summary, confirm button.
* **PositionsTable** (new): legs, qty, avg price, mark, P&L, resolve date, actions.
* **ReceiptsPanel** (new): receipt timeline + download.
* **Alerts/Toasts** (new): fills, risk limits hit, resolution events.
* **State management**: persist hedges/positions (Zustand/Redux) + URL state.

# Backend & services you’re missing

* **Market indexer**

  * Ingest titles/descriptions/resolution rules & odds from venues (Polymarket now; Kalshi/OTC later).
  * Store in Postgres; embed resolution text (pgvector) for semantic retrieval.
* **Risk indexer & scorer**

  * **Fit score**: rule-text parser vs `ExposureSpec`.
  * **Liquidity model**: rolling depth/spread; size feasibility.
  * **Proxy score**: simple co-movement with external signals (freight index, FX, news count).
* **Basket optimizer**

  * Pick legs + weights under a budget; cap proxies; minimize residual basis per simple constraints.
* **Execution service (OMS)**

  * Place/cancel/replace; TWAP/iceberg; slippage guards; idempotent retries.
  * Paper-trade/sim mode for dev.
* **Compliance gate**

  * KYB/KYC status, geofence, venue allowlist, notional/risk limits per user.
* **Receipts service**

  * Immutable log of spec → shortlist → chosen basket → orders/fills; hash and store.
* **Streaming updates**

  * SSE/WebSocket for quotes, fills, resolution events, P&L.

# Data model you’ll need (minimum set)

* `ExposureSpec`: id, statement, horizon, budget, venues_allowed, jurisdiction.
* `Market`: id, venue, title, rule_text, window, tick_size, fee, tags.
* `Candidate`: {exposure_id, market_id, fit, depth_est, cost_est}.
* `Basket`: {exposure_id, items:[{market_id, side, weight, order_type, limits}]}.
* `Order/Fill`: standard OMS records + venue refs.
* `Receipt`: hashes, timestamps, signer, links to all above.

# Compliance, safety, and ops (don’t skip)

* **User/Org & roles**, approvals for >X notional, **kill switch**.
* **Secrets** via runtime vault; **per-venue API key rotation**.
* **Rate limiting** (per user & per venue).
* **Audit logs** and **export** (JSON/PDF).
* **Error taxonomy** with friendly UI states (venue down, illiquid, rule mismatch).
* **Observability**: metrics, traces, alerting (Grafana/OTel).
* **Testing**: unit (parsers), integration (venue stubs), e2e (Playwright), chaos tests (venue errors).

# UI acceptance criteria (quick checklist)

* Exposure form shows **coverage %** + **residual band** before execution.
* Candidate list shows **Rule text** (1-click), **Fit**, **Liquidity**, **Window**, **Fees**.
* Execution sheet displays **max spend**, **expected slippage**, **orders preview**.
* Positions page shows **resolve clocks** and **rebalance** with guardrails.
* Receipts are downloadable and verifiable.

# “Build next” short list

1. **ExposureForm + CandidateList + ExecutionSheet** (frontend).
2. **Market indexer + scorer API** (backend).
3. **Paper-trade OMS + receipts** (backend + UI).
4. Swap your graph’s metrics to **event nodes** with **fit/liquidity badges**.
5. Add **Positions/Blotter** view with live updates.

you can also add poly market api or metamask api into the project: https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/endpoints
you can also add agents using openai like client, api key in .env file, base url is https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 , agent model using qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking
